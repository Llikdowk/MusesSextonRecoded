# MusesSextonRecoded

Muses Sexton is a game done for the [Adventure Game Jam 2016](http://gamejolt.com/games/muses-sexton/149995).
As I had neither enough time nor experience I ended up with a monolithic and tightly coupled code. The result was a buggy game. You can check the original code [here](https://github.com/Llikdowk/MusesSexton).

This project is a recodification of that one. The result is far from perfect and it has still a few bugs but now the code has a solid structure and bugs are now easy to spot and debug.
